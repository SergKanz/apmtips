Please welcome JavaScript SDK on [github](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS). Recently I [explained](/blog/2015/03/18/javascript-snippet-explained/) snippet code you need to inject to your project to use Application Insights JavaScript SDK. Now you can see the code of the main script. Please report issues on github and welcome to contribute!
