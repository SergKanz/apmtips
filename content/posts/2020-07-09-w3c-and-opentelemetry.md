W3C [Distributed Tracing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/) is working on standards in distributed tracing space. These standards has viriety of applications from distributed tracing to business process workflow management. However, the project most aligned with this work is [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io). Here are some notes on Opentelemetry and W3C Distributed Tracing working group relationships. 


Like every standard development - it is an investment that may not have an immidiate pay off. Thus, every contribution is very valuable.

The topic of distributed tracing may not be among the typical W3C led specifications, but our group agrees that W3C is the best home for our work. 

The working group charter is [about to be refreshed](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/214) and in pursue of approving it I was wondered what companies contributed to OpenTelemetry and maintain the membership in W3C.
