[@MarioHewardt](https://twitter.com/MarioHewardt) - very good person, author of [Advanced Windows and Advanced .NET Debugging](http://www.amazon.com/Mario-Hewardt/e/B001IGT4XO) books, courses on [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/mario-hewardt) joined Application Insights team. Check out his [blog](http://thrivingapp.com/) for couple nice Application Insights related articles and more.

Is it time to make Application Insights a little bit more hardcore?
